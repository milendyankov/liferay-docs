= Embedded vs. Remote Operation Mode 

When you install @product@, Elasticsearch is already embedded. In embedded mode,
Elasticsearch search runs in the same JVM to make it easy to test-drive with
minimal configuration. Running both servers in the same process has drawbacks:

* Elasticsearch must use the same JVM options as @product@.
* @product@ and Elasticsearch compete for resources.

[WARNING]
====
You wouldn't run an embedded database like HSQL in production, and you shouldn't
run Elasticsearch in embedded mode in production either. Instead, run
Elasticsearch in _remote operation mode_, as a standalone server or cluster of
server nodes.
