= Troubleshooting Elasticsearch 

Sometimes things don't go as planned. If you've set up @product@ with
Elasticsearch in remote mode, but @product@ can't connect to Elasticsearch, check
these things:

*Cluster name:*::
The value of the `cluster.name` property in Elasticsearch must match the
`clusterName` property you configured for Liferay's Elasticsearch adapter.

*Transport address:*::
The value of the `transportAddress` property in the Elasticsearch adapter must
match the port where Elasticsearch is running. If @product@ is running in
embedded mode, and you start a standalone Elasticsearch node or cluster, it
detects that port `9300` is taken and switches to port `9301`. If you then set
Liferay's Elasticsearch adapter to remote mode, it continues to look for
Elasticsearch at the default port (`9300`).

The next two articles cover the Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch's
configuration options in more detail.
