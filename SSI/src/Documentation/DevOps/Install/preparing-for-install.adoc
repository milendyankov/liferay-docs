= Preparing for Install

Installing @product@ is easy. But before you begin, you should answer a few
questions.

* Which version of Liferay will you install?
* On which application server will you install @product@?
* Can you install a @product@ bundle or do you need to install @product@ on an
existing application server?
* Which database will you use with @product@?
* How do you plan to store your data?
* Can your network support @product@?
