[NOTE]
====
@product@ by default ships with an embedded version of Elasticsearch. While this
configuration works well for demo purposes, it is not supported in a production
installation. After you install @product@, you'll should configure it to
connect to a standalone Elasticsearch server or cluster. 
====

Elasticsearch and Solr are both supported, but there are some differences in how
they work with @product@. If an application requires the use of the `TermsSetFilter` API or the
Geolocation APIs you must use Elasticsearch as it is OLNY implemented in the Liferay's Elasticsearch Connector.
