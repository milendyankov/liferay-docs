= Ports

== HTTP / AJP ports

Liferay's application server (e.g., Tomcat or
Wildfly) uses certain ports for purposes like handling incoming HTTP
requests, HTTPS requests, or AJP requests, etc. If you start your
application server in debug mode, there's a port listening for a debugger to
connect. If desired, you can configure these ports. Please refer to your
application server's documentation for information on its default ports and
how to configure them.

== Remote Console port

Liferay also provides access to its OSGi framework through a configurable
port:

    module.framework.properties.osgi.console=localhost:11311

You can override this default property by copying the line above to your
`LIFERAY_HOME/portal-ext.properties` file and adjusting the port number.
