= Setup Wizard

The Setup Wizard runs when you start @product@ for the first time. The title of
the setup wizard page is Basic Configuration. This page provides a convenient
way to make an initial configuration.

There are two sections of the wizard: the portal and the administrator.  For the
portal, you need to supply the following information:

*Portal Name:* the name of the portal you're powering with @product@.

*Default Language:* choose the default locale of your portal.

For the administrator, you need to supply the following information:

*First Name:* the first name of the default administrator user

*Last Name:* the last name of the default administrator user

*Email:* the email address of the default administrator user

The Basic Configuration page also includes a checkbox labeled _Add Sample Data_.
If you check this box, sample data is added to your database. This data includes
users, sites, and organizations. The sample data is for demo purposes. If you're
installing @product@ on your own machine to explore its features, the sample
data may be useful. If, however, you're installing @product@ on a real server,
start with a clean system.

Once you've filled out the form, click _Finish Configuration_. The setup wizard
creates a `portal-setup-wizard.properties` file which stores the settings that
you entered. When you begin customizing your portal's configuration, however,
use the `portal-ext.properties` file you created earlier. All the
possible properties that can be placed in this file are documented in
http://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0/propertiesdoc[our reference documentation].

== Disable Setup Wizard

The wizard is an extremely helpful tool, especially if you're setting
up @product@ for the first time. If you're a veteran and you already have
your various properties set up, you can disable the setup wizard. If you disable
the setup wizard, you must configure everything manually from the
`portal-ext.properties` file. To disable the setup wizard, enter
`setup.wizard.enabled=false` in your `portal-ext.properties` file. 

[Note]
====
Property values in `portal-setup-wizard.properties` (the file created in Liferay
Home by the setup wizard) override property values in `portal-ext.properties`.
